# Coding BootCamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for wanting to dive deep into the world of coding was because i've always loved gaming and wanted to understand the backend of how games or websites for games are created, which is what fueled my interest in learning about coding. I decided to document my build this project not only as a reference for myself but for anyone wanting to learn and be able to have template to help and guide them through the long journey into the world of coding. This study guide help solve the simple and basic starter points and building blocks for building a webpage and being able to start understand how coding works. I learned all about the three main components of building a webpage which consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with how developers collaborate on projects by using the gitbash and uploading the files from your local computer onto a cloud server known as github.
